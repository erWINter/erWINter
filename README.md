- 👋 Hi, I’m erWINter -an old crow- retired S/W developer with main focus: telemetry processing & process-automation
- 👀 I’m interested in Micro-Processor H/W(PIC-12/14,Arduino,esp8266) & S/W for home/hobby/music applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to play Tenor Ukulele, which is much fun.
- 💞️ I still love to collaborate with my ex-colleague working at GSOC for multi-mission satellite support.
